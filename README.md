# Lookout
A Python script that tells you which of your images are being used in other profiles on F-List.

Just download and run lookout.py. You'll be asked to provide your login credentials, which are required to generate a ticket so that the script can get the list of images from your character.

The first time you run it, you'll need to download the hash DB from the server. This may take a while.
